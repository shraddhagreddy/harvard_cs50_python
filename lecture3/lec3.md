# loops
- helps to do something to do again and again
- why is print("meow") repeatedly bad?
    you are just repeating urself
    logical extension- if we had to do it a large number of times -> not the simplest and is ugly
    and if we have to make changes- we have to change every small thing again and again 

## while
- express a loop
- picture it like keeping all fingers up and counting down.

## for loop
- allow us to express ourselves a little differently
- we use list

## List
- type of data 
- way of containing multiple things 
- [] represents a list 

-learn about break
-learn about continue

### minor improvement u can name a variable _ instead of an i, if it does not matter to you 

## dict
- dictionaries
- data structures to associate one value with another
- keys and values
- helps u associate something with something else
- uses curly braces
- ### if we use a for loop while iterating over a dict it always returns the key 
- here, there is a keyword None
