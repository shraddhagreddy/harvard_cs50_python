# Exceptions

- when something has gone wrong 
- Syntax error
- Runtime error

## try
- can check whether something exceptional has happened 
- ValueError: occurs when you give a function or operation a value of the right type but an inappropriate or invalid value.
- while trying the try- except method, we should know the error right? 
    like ValueError for example
    what to do if u cannot anticipate the type of error?

    ### ans
    - u can omit ValueError and just say except
    - but it is a bad practice as u wont know what is wrong with it
    - try to figure out what is wrong 
    - try with everything

- we can use else as well
- ###  adding loops

### - pass
### - raise is also there \\will be done later
